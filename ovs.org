Open vSwitch Cheat Sheet

* Architecture
Open vSwitch is comprised of three parts:

| Component          | Description                            | Commandline Control             |
|--------------------+----------------------------------------+---------------------------------|
| osvdb-server       | database storing switch configuration  | ovs-vsctl, ovsdb-tool (offline) |
| ovs-vswitchd       | slow path implementing OpenFlow switch | ovs-ofctl                       |
| openvswitch_mod.ko | fast path (kernel module)              | ovs-dpctl                       |


See [[http://www.yet.org/images/posts/ovs-archi.png][diagram]] for relationship between components.


* Commandline Control
** ovs-vsctl
The [[http://openvswitch.org/support/dist-docs/ovs-vsctl.8.txt][ovs-vsctl]] program configures ovs-vswitchd(8) by providing a
high-level interface to its configuration database.  See
ovs-vswitchd.conf.db(5) for comprehensive documentation of the
database schema.

** ovsdb-tool
The [[http://openvswitch.org/support/dist-docs/ovsdb-tool.1.txt][ovsdb-tool]] program is a command-line tool for managing Open
vSwitch database (OVSDB) files.  It does not interact directly with
running Open vSwitch database servers (instead, use ovsdb-client).


** ovs-ofctl
The [[http://openvswitch.org/support/dist-docs/ovs-ofctl.8.txt][ovs-ofctl]] program is a command line tool for monitoring and admin‐
istering OpenFlow switches.  It can also show the current state of an
OpenFlow switch, including features, configuration, and table entries.
It should work with *any* OpenFlow switch, not just Open vSwitch.

*** Management
show switch <switch>     print info on switch
dump-tables <switch>     statistics for each of the flow tables used
dump-flows <switch>      print tables
dump-ports <switch>      

*** Flow Table
add-flow <switch> <flow>  

*** Group Table


*** Monitoring
snoop <switch>        print all received OpenFlow messages
monitor <switch>

*** Switch and Controller
probe <switch>
ping <switch> [n]

** ovs-dpctl
The [[http://openvswitch.org/support/dist-docs/ovs-dpctl.8.txt][ovs-dpctl]] program can create, modify, and delete Open vSwitch
datapaths.  A single machine may host any number of datapaths.

TODO: speaks to kernel module

This program works only with datapaths that are implemented outside of
ovs-vswitchd itself, such as the Linux and Windows kernel-based data‐
paths.  To manage datapaths that are integrated into ovs-vswitchd,
such as the userspace (netdev) datapath, use ovs-appctl(8) to invoke
the dpctl/* commands, which are documented in ovs-vswitchd(8).

** ovs-appctl
Open vSwitch daemons (TODO) accept certain commands at runtime to control
their behavior and query their settings.  Every daemon accepts a
common set of commands documented under COMMON COMMANDS below.

ovs-appctl ofproto/trace <switch> in_port=1,dl_dst=01:80:c2:00:00:05






** TODO
- what are the valid fields for matching?
