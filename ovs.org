Open vSwitch Cheat Sheet

* Commands
** ovs-vsctl
The [[http://openvswitch.org/support/dist-docs/ovs-vsctl.8.txt][ovs-vsctl]] program configures ovs-vswitchd(8) by providing a
high-level interface to its configuration database.  See
ovs-vswitchd.conf.db(5) for comprehensive documentation of the
database schema.




** ovs-ofctl
The [[http://openvswitch.org/support/dist-docs/ovs-ofctl.8.txt][ovs-ofctl]] program is a command line tool for monitoring and admin‚Äê
istering OpenFlow switches.  It can also show the current state of an
OpenFlow switch, including features, configuration, and table entries.
It should work with any OpenFlow switch, not just Open vSwitch.
